They will go by that for the purpose of night actions. Do with that what you will. There are no limits (with the exception of Bulbagarden Rules) to this. You will be most often referred to as being this alias, and both you and other players will not know innately the player behind the alias, unless shared.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>When you die, your Alias <i>and</i> actual identity will be revealed. Until you die, both your Alias and actual identity will be present on the Living Player and Living Alias Lists.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>No being a jerk.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>No Loophole abuse.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Consult me if you feel as though you've discovered a loophole. I may reward you for it.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>There are no hidden players.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Non-players (Host, M.O.D.s, Informed Observers) are not involved in the game. Targeting them with roles and/or killing them will be a waste of time. You have enough to worry about.</li></ul><b>Rules Regarding Roles/Night Actions/Phase Operations:</b><br><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>Submission (Joining)</b><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Submit all actions formally via your <b>RolePM</b>. These are used for Timestamp confirmation, and will not be accepted by Discord submission or any other way.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>Phase Time Handling</b><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>N1 & N2 are 48 hours. N3-> are 24 hours. With only nights, Lynches won't occur (even though the game will clearly take place during the daytime).</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Once I receive all actions, and publically declare it, actions are considered locked and phase ends.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Late Submission/No-Shows for Night Actions (with no justification) get slapped on the wrist the first time and Mod-killed the second time.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>Action Submission/Targetting</b><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>By default, all players can only target Aliases. Exceptions may apply, but these will be rare, if at all.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>All actions will have a predetermined order of Priority.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If things occurred over a night phase that do not make sense to you, it is possible that the priorities of roles varied from what you expected.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>This, along with a full list of night actions, roles, etc, will be released in Postgame.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>No Self-targeting unless your role specifically states so.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>You may target the dead/nonlisted players and/or aliases, but I cannot promise that results will occur.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>You can submit actions in your RolePM (on Bulbagarden), or to me in Discord.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If you are submitting actions to me in Discord, please bold it and label it as you see below.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>I will Pin submitted discord night actions in your Discord, and also copy/paste them into your Bulba RolePM, <i>and also</i>, I will post results in your Bulba RolePM.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>Night 1:</b><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>##Shoot [Player 2]</b></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>##Other Ability [Player 3]</b></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>##Etc</b></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><b>Results Interpretation</b><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If I reply to your RolePM with results, you will be given a count of BPVs, and a full historical breakdown of action results.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If you are hit, but also obtained a new BPV, you will be informed of both, not just the current balance of BPVs in your stock</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If your action or shot has been redirected, you will know who it was redirected to.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If I do not specify if your action on [X] was successful/failed, but simply state that it was successful, it means that your attempt of targetting [X] did indeed target [X].</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If your action or shot fails, you will be given clues to interpret how.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>For instance, if I tell you "Your shot on [X] failed", it is safe to assume that something prevented you from firing. If I tell you "Your shot on [X] succeeded", but the results are not what you would have expected (maybe you shot a person with doctor's protection), then your shot did what it was supposed to do and a different role altered the results..</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>I will not declare player's Role(s) until flips, outside of investigative abilities; that's for you to figure out.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>RP is encouraged, but not mandatory.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>When in doubt, follow your RolePM. There may be exceptions of roles which defy the rules stated above.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Anything written in your RolePM will take precedence over Rules.</li></ul></li></ul><b>Rules Regarding Winning/Losing:</b><br><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>All players will have two Bullet Proof Vests (BPV) to start.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>You will be notified if your BPV has been hit.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><i>A BPV will only protect against one hit.</i></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul><i>If you are targeted by more killing actions than vests that you have during a night, and have no other outside means of protection from your role(s) or another player's role(s), you will die.</i></li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>All users have a base factional kill that they can submit towards any other player.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If you die before fulfilling your win condition, you cannot win with your failed win condition. You have lost. Sorry.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>The amount of winners that this game can have is 1 + [Player Count divided by 10].<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>For example, if 9 players join, there can be 1 winner.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If 10-19 join, there can be 2 winners</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>20-29, 3 winners</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Etc</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If somehow, there are 0 players alive at the point in which a winner would be decided, I will decide what happens when that happens. It hasn't happened in years, so it'd be a first for me to plan around.</li></ul><b>Rules Regarding Outside Communication (OC), for Players and NonPlayers:</b><br><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>No Editing in-thread posts.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Please minimize OC log editing (if it cannot be avoided).</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Posting in thread and communicating via Outside Contact is ok. Heck, it's basically mandatory.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>As this game is OC, communicate with other players however you want.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Include me in your logs though (Discord/QT/PM/smoke signal/HAM radio, etc). This will make Postgame all the better!</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>You <i>must</i> include me (Elieson) in any and all OC activity. This is so I can verify respect of rules and prevent potential drama from occurring, or resolve any that does start before it becomes a significant issue. Also, I'm nosey.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Do not screenshot OC conversations or Mod-sent Messages (like your Role and Results) with other players, with the intent to share them with other players. Copy/Pasting is allowed, and encouraged. Logs sent in this format can be meddled with but as long as I have the original, what you send to others is free game.<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>To clarify, you are allowed to copy and paste chat logs to each other, and you can edit the text as you see fit. Do this at your own risk, because lying may help you win, or help you lose. That said, I encourage seeing players lie, because eventually, all alliances must crumble...</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Again, NO SCREENSHOTS of Mod-to-you PMs (aka don't screenshot messages I send to your RolePM). Copy/Paste is ok...or fake it, I don't care! As long as it's not a screenshot, I don't care.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Those who are not participating in the game, or those that are dead and out of the game, should not interfere with those who are living, and should minimize communication with outside nonplayers. If someone plans to sub into this game, they would be banned from doing so if they join with outside knowledge. That said, if you want to join the game as an Informed Observer (IO), please post so in the thread, and you'll be included in OC chats.</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>If a player is dead, they're dead, with no hopes of coming back. You living folk can rant to the dead, but you dead folk are forbidden from sharing information about the living/active gamestate.</li></ul><b>Banned Roles/Abilities:</b> <span class=button-text><span>Spoiler</span></span> The following roles in their original/full form are banned (These have been present in OC games in which I've participated in, or hosted, and have proven to be too imbalanced to be truly fun for the game):<br><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Communism</u>: equalizes BPV counts among all players<li data-xf-list-type=ol>This is both annoying for me as a host, and for the playerbase.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Rule Maker</u>: changes the rules of the game<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Rules are carefully crafted by the host, and are too hard to limit outside involvement for maintaining balance</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Faust</u>: access to the mod sheet<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Too much info. 'Nuff said.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Ganon Cannon</u>: an unblockable real time kill which unstoppably kills the target and doesn’t need an Alias but rather a player name for its target<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Perfect Aim defies the point of Alias submission, and instant death is too much power for any one person to deserve.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Resurrector</u>: brings a dead player back into the game<li data-xf-list-type=ol>This goes against the spirit of Mafia, in my opinion.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Hidden</u>: players that are not on the player or alias list<li data-xf-list-type=ol>These players effectively cannot lose, or are too often spoiled before games even start. To prevent this from being an issue, the Hidden type is just banned.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Question Asker</u>: unrestricted QAs that can ask the host anything about game state<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Too much info. 'Nuff said.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Permanent Vanillizer</u>: causes a player to lose their roles permanently<li data-xf-list-type=ol>I didn't build roles just to neutralize them! That said, Temporary Vanillization is not banned.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Medium</u>: gives access to the graveyard<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Graveyard people often have too much info to share, and this is way too huge of an advantage. Also, this often leads to more drama than any human being wants to deal with.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Self-busdriver</u>: a bus driver that is able to switch themselves with another player<li data-xf-list-type=ol>When paired with other roles, is effectively immune to actions while also punishing another person.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Immortal</u>: cannot be killed<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Does this need explaining?</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>NOC Enforcer</u>: causes a player to lose their abilities to Outside Contact<li data-xf-list-type=ol>Nobody joins an OC game that wants to be stuck talking to nobody, outside of their control.</li></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><u>Real-Time Investigators</u>: Any kind of role which punishes players for early action submissions (real-time Tracker/Watcher, etc)<li data-xf-list-type=ol>This is just too powerful, as it's too easy to mess with actions post-submission, and gives unfair info advantage.</li></li><br>TLDR, the Standard Rules may seem daunting, but it's basically just a summary of how the game works. Basically, we're all just sitting around a game table and the rules are half etiquette and half obvious stuff, with a couple of specifics thrown in because they have to be. Worth a close read, but few rules, if any, should warrant a reread.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMRmqZ6spae7brvFZpyloZWovK95z6ucrJ2eqcBusdWeqbKan5nGbrXSZqSanpmWeq6txaKYZp%2BRorJuv9Oaqa1lmqq7pnmRamVsaGFthHd7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./timaya-shares-photo-with-rihanna-as-he-celebrates-her-pregnancy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Timaya Shares Photo With Rihanna As He Celebrates Her Pregnancy">&larr;
