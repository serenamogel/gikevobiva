Those were the words of NASA astronaut Ed White as he re-entered his spacecraft, having become the first American astronaut to take a spacewalk, during the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965. Two years later, White's space endeavors proved tragic when he, along with fellow pilots Virgil "Gus" Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee, were assigned to the Apollo 1 mission. During a launch rehearsal test at Cape Kennedy on January 27, all three men were killed after a fire broke out in their cabin.

However, because he lacked test pilot experience, he found the position difficult to manage, which contributed to his clinical depression and alcohol addiction. He went on to write to two autobiographies, Return to Earth (1973) and Magnificent Desolation (2009), that discussed these struggles in detail.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">These days, Aldrin continues to be active in space exploration advocacy and is working with Purdue University to create a spacecraft trajectory to Mars called the Aldrin cycler.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Jim Lovell (Pablo Schreiber)</h2><img alt="James A.
