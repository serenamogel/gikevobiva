Can’t wait until she gets caught. It’s time,” commented one fan on Instagram.</p><p>While this fan added: “Phyllis is sooooo not dead…this is part of her and Stark’s plan”</p><p>This fan was on ‘Team Diane’ but still believes Phyllis’s death isn’t to be believed: “Team Diane on this. Phyllis is too obsessed with Diane. Love Phyllis too but she needs a new hobby and a new man. Faking her death just to get back at Diane is only going to backfire on her.”</p><p>“Yeah, she ain’t really dead,” commented this viewer. “She had this planned with him [Jeremy] to catch Diane in some type of trap and make it look like she killed her.”</p><p>And finally, this fan said what many were thinking: “Don’t worry the dead on soaps never die.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-4141-1024x518.png><p>The Young And The Restless <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">airs on weekdays</a> at 12:30pm ET on CBS.</p><h3 class=tags-title>Related Topics</h3><p><h2>MORE TV STORIES</h2><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXTnGWcp51ksq95xptma2hiaHxxgI5pa2ivmJbBbrTAqaeeppWZerW7jKmfsqScnsBuu81msKitnpx6orrDZquhnV2nsrTAy56qrGWWlru0ecCrnKesXZi8r8LIp5qenF2otaZ5w6KcnWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./harry-hill-net-worth-149799.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harry Hill Net Worth">&larr;
