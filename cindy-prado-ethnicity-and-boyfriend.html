With over 2.7 million followers currently across all social media platforms, the blonde social media model is amplifying her voice to empower, inspire, and leave a lasting good influence.</strong></p><p>Prado is always adapting to new opportunities, building her brand and advocacy globally while staying true to her mission of inspiring and empowering the next generation. She says that the reason her fans support her is because she is genuine and true to herself both in front of and behind the camera.</p><h2><span id=Cindy_Prado8217s_age_ethnicity_included_how_old_is_she>Cindy Prado’s age; ethnicity included, how old is she?</span></h2><p>Cindy Prado, a Florida model that is currently 30 years old, was born on January 20, 1992. Miami is where Prado was born and reared.</p><p>Although she acknowledges that some people think she’s Latina, her true ancestry is Spanish and Cuban. Her ancestors were from the Spanish island of Canarias.</p><h2><span id=Cindy_Prado_Began_Her_Model_Career_When>Cindy Prado Began Her Model Career When?</span></h2><p>Prado has been involved in various global campaigns since the beginning.</p><p>Before starting her then-247,000-strong Instagram account, the Cuban-American model began her modeling career in her mid-teens for fashion brands including 1sol swimwear and Maaji swimwear. She has walked in catwalk shows and modeled for a number of designers throughout the years, including Micro Kitten.</p><p>She has also collaborated with numerous other large organizations, like The Smile Society, BED Miami, and Telemundo, and appeared on an eight-page spread in FHM and Maxim magazines.</p><p>Prado stated in an interview that she has always been a performer, whether it is through small-scale talent shows as a child, dancing in high school, or even taking pictures of herself with her parents.</p><h2><span id=Cindy_claims_that_at_first_she_struggled_to_get_into_modeling>Cindy claims that at first, she struggled to get into modeling.</span></h2><p>Cindy Prado claims that even though she was a performer, things weren’t always simple for her at first.</p><p>The stunning woman of Southern descent was able to pursue modeling more when she was older, but she soon discovered that it was challenging to get into an agency at the time if one wasn’t 5’10”. It was then that she made the decision to act independently.</p><p>Fortunately, Cindy notes that was also the moment when Instagram began to take off. She announced her decision to forgo a modeling agency on Instagram. The Instagram influencer turned entrepreneur began shooting her own images, paying for her own outfit for these “shoots” and hiring shooters out of her own pocket.</p><p>To make it happen, I simply had to take the necessary steps. Gradually, I began to finally take off!</p><p>Prado spoke about her early days of modeling.</p><p>She also acknowledges that at the start of her career, she had a great deal of stress and wondered if she should pursue this path or just obtain a regular job.</p><p>Nevertheless, Prado made the decision to embrace the modeling experience and follow her path. Luckily, the job has helped her grow a lot throughout the years. She has previously balanced her studies in public relations and marketing with modeling.</p><h2><span id=Cindy_Prado_Offers_A_Program_For_Mental_Health>Cindy Prado Offers A Program For Mental Health</span></h2><p>A virtual mental health treatment program called Cerebral is another one of Prado’s collaboration brands.</p><p>She previously stated that she wants to use her experience with Cerebral to connect her fans, friends, and family with tools that will support their wellbeing and raise awareness of the value of good mental health.</p><p>She claims that having Cerebral as a spouse is a blessing.</p><h2><span id=Moreover_Prado_Offers_An_Online_Fitness_Program>Moreover, Prado Offers An Online Fitness Program</span></h2><p>With her online fitness program, the Prado program, Cindy Prado claims that anyone who joins may reach her and share their growth, motivations, and mental health check-ins. They can also have conversations about thinking positively and staying motivated.</p><p>Prado uses her internet platform to discuss with her audience her personal practices for practicing better mental health.</p><p>Cindy thinks she could be as honest and open with her fans as possible by giving them a glimpse into her life, particularly when it comes to the need for mutual empowerment.</p><p>In June 2021, she also introduced her influencer course, which consisted of 12 episodes featuring her tale and training on content creation, equipment she used (and how to utilize it), and brand negotiations.</p><p>She Likes to Give Back As Well Prado points out, her celebrity also gives her the opportunity to use her clout for charitable causes. Her collaboration with the Miami Heat Cheer and Dance team serves as one example of how she empowers other women by using social media to help them discover who they are.</p><p>The 33-26-36 model has been working together to try and instill confidence in women by creating a trickle-down effect.</p><h2><span id=Is_She_Dating_Anyone>Is She Dating Anyone?</span></h2><p>Although Prado isn’t currently discussing or even making jokes about her romantic relationships or boyfriend, she did once obliquely allude to something in that vein.</p><p>In June 2012, Cindy was questioned by Elite Daily, “How many drinks before he (a guy) gets lucky?” The model, currently based in Los Angeles, replied,</p><p>As of right moment, there’s only one lucky person—and they don’t even need alcohol.</p><p>Even though her response implied that she already had a partner at the time, she didn’t go into much detail about it. She did, however, acknowledge having quite a few dates in the same interview.</p><p>The five-foot-seven-inch tall woman went on to say that she would never date a male model.</p><h2><span id=Additional_Information>Additional Information</span></h2><p>Cindy Prado once declared that having lunch with British-Lebanese lawyer Amal Clooney is her ideal lunch companion.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>businesswoman</a> <a href=# rel=tag>fitness entrepreneur</a> <a href=# rel=tag>influencer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Model</a> <a href=# rel=tag>wellness leader</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Dennis Quaid Sexuality | Is He Gay | Explore His Relationship And Wiki</a></h3>Many people are fascinated by Dennis Quaid's personal life, and there have been sporadic speculations and rumors regarding his sexual orientation.Dennis Quaid, a gifted and charismatic actor, has <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Meet Clare Polkinghorne Brother Tom And Liam Polkinghorne | Parents And Family</a></h3>A skilled professional soccer player from Australia, Clare Elizabeth Polkinghorne is well-known for her defensive abilities. 1989 saw the birth of Polkinghorne on February 1st.
