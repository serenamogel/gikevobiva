The family struggled financially and moved roughly 10 times in a decade. At one point, the four lived at a Comfort Inn in Orange County, California, with Trinity and D.J. eating waffles in the hotel lobby for breakfast. Lima helped care for Trinity and D.J., taking them to school and sports practices.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even as Trinity’s athletic career blossomed, her father has remained mainly out of her life. He surprised her by appearing at a 2021 NWSL playoff game. However, Trinity has said they still go months or even years without speaking to each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Like I’ve said before, I’ve gotten closure with it all.

While D.J. gravitated to basketball like his father, Trinity showed a competitive streak in soccer at a young age. “I realized that soccer was going to be my thing when I couldn’t accept that people could play a sport just for fun,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.espn.com/espnw/story/_/id/34032358/future-american-soccer-arrived data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said Rodman" data-vars-ga-product-id=a75e626b-f168-4f00-94a8-9d0366362db6 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.espn.com/espnw/story/_/id/34032358/future-american-soccer-arrived data-product-url=https://www.espn.com/espnw/story/_/id/34032358/future-american-soccer-arrived data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fespnw%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F34032358%2Ffuture-american-soccer-arrived" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=379213f6-fe02-4ab6-a698-7b9eeb56355e class="body-link product-links css-1dhrel9 e1aq0z090">said Rodman</a>, who, even at age 4, was focused on scoring goals and winning all her games. A handful of years later, she began to establish herself as one of California’s most promising young athletes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Rodman was 9, she joined the SoCal Blues youth club team. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/6295436/trinity-rodman-world-cup-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to her coach" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">According to her coach</a>, Greg Baker, Trinity was “one of the most athletic kids in Southern California since the day she stepped on the field.” Baker believed in Rodman’s ability so much that he helped cover her annual dues and fees, which totaled thousands of dollars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Baker, Rodman could juggle a soccer ball on her foot at a rate of 120 beats per minute on a metronome. However, she also habitually lost possession during games, leading to the unflattering nickname “Turnover Trinity.” Thanks to film study and extra passing practice, Rodman was able to shed this moniker and lead the team to unprecedented success. Rodman and the Blues won four national youth championships in the Elite Clubs National League.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a high school freshman, Rodman played one season of soccer at Corona del Mar High School before transferring to JSerra Catholic High School and focusing solely on her club team. The attacker also drew attention by playing internationally for the United States in the Under-17 and Under-20 divisions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The high-scoring forward impressed NCAA scouts and first committed to the University of California, Los Angeles, but eventually signed with Washington State University in December 2019. However, Rodman didn’t play a single collegiate match after the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of her 2020 freshman season. She decided to turn pro immediately instead.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Pro Career in the NWSL" data-anchor-id=pro-career-in-the-nwsl class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emt9r7s1">Pro Career in the NWSL</h2><img alt="trinity rodman wearing her soccer uniform and a headband and looking up and out of frame" title="Trinity Rodman in the NWSL playoffs" width=3534 height=2357 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/trinity-rodman-of-washington-spirit-looks-to-the-crowd-as-news-photo-1714679842.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Trinity Rodman was a draft selection of the Washington Spirit NWSL club in 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite her lost college season, the Washington Spirit of the NWSL saw enough potential in Rodman to make her the second overall pick in the 2021 draft. Then, at 18, she became the league’s youngest draft selection ever. Because of the success of young players like Rodman, the NWSL has since eliminated its 18-year age restriction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rodman fit in from the start with her more experienced teammates and opponents, scoring seven goals and adding seven assists as a rookie. She led the Spirit to the NWSL championship match on November 20, when she assisted Kelley O’Hara’s goal in extra time to give the team its first league title.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Named the NWSL Rookie of the Year, Rodman signed the largest contract in league history in February 2022: a four-year agreement worth $1.1 million, or $281,000 annually, plus the opportunity to earn more through endorsements. “I’m that person that broke the mold for that.
