Her father Albert, known as “Bertie” to his family, was the second son of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/george-v data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="King George V" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">King George V</a>.

Tentative, nervous and prone to both ill health and a relentless stutter, he found public speeches and appearances agonizing. But, as the war began, he found his footing. Bolstered by his wife and government officials, including Prime Minister <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/winston-churchill data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Winston Churchill" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Winston Churchill</a>, the king <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/windsors-war-ww2-royal-family-what-did-they-do-nazi-germany-george-vi-elizabeth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="helped rally the morale" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">helped rally the morale</a> of the British people, refusing to leave London despite repeated aerial attacks by Nazi planes that left cities in ruins.

She refused, stating, “The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." But, like thousands of other children who were evacuated from British cities, Elizabeth and Margaret did leave London, spending much of the war at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-the-royal-family-did-during-the-second-world-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Windsor Castle" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Windsor Castle</a>.

But her protective parents refused to allow her to enlist, noting that no female member of the royal family had ever joined the military. Elizabeth was a dutiful daughter, but she was also strong-willed. It took more than a year of debate before her family <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-queen-elizabeth-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="finally relented" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">finally relented</a> in early 1945, giving the now 19-year-old permission to join up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That February she joined the Women’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stripes.com/news/europe/was-queen-elizabeth-really-a-mechanic-during-world-war-ii-1.584439 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Auxiliary Territory Service" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Auxiliary Territory Service</a> (similar to the American Women’s Army Corps or WACs), registered as inductee <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37205/supplement/3972 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="No. 230873" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">No. 230873</a>, under the name Elizabeth Windsor. The ATS provided key support during the war, with its members serving as anti-aircraft gunners, radio operators, mechanics and drivers.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The sheltered princess took to her new role with gusto</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She underwent a six-week auto mechanic training course at Aldershot in Surrey, and by July had risen from the rank of Second Subaltern to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/06/04/trump-said-queen-elizabeth-was-mechanic-during-wwii-is-that-real/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Junior Commander" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Junior Commander</a>. She learned how to deconstruct, repair and rebuild engines and change tires, and learned how to drive every type of machine she worked on, including jeeps, trucks and ambulances. As a 1947 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://mashable.com/2015/04/22/queen-elizabeth-army/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Collier’s magazine" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Collier’s magazine</a> article noted of the overalls-clad teen, “One of her major joys was to get dirt under her nails and grease stains in her hands, and display these signs of labor to her friends.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the first time, Elizabeth worked alongside her fellow Brits, relishing the freedom she had previously been denied. But there were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/windsors-war-ww2-royal-family-what-did-they-do-nazi-germany-george-vi-elizabeth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=concessions class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">concessions</a> to her rank. She ate many of her meals in an officer’s mess hall, not with other enlistees. And each night she was driven home to the safety of Windsor Castle.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The Associated Press dubbed her 'Princess Auto Mechanic'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elizabeth took her ATS duties seriously, but the idea of a future queen repairing automobiles proved irresistible. Her enlistment made headlines around the world, with newspapers applauding the young princess’ commitment to the war effort and calling her "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5287517/world-war-ii-queen-elizabeth-photo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Auto Mechanic" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Princess Auto Mechanic</a>." And though her parents had proved resistant to the idea of her joining the military, they were immensely proud of their daughter, paying a visit to her ATS unit in April 1945, with younger daughter Margaret — and a fleet of reporters and newsreel cameramen — in tow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elizabeth was still in the ATS when Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, and she and Margaret famously slipped out of Buckingham Palace to join revelers celebrating in London. Her military service ended with Japan’s surrender later that year. The war was over, but it had taken its toll on the royal family. George VI had helped lead his country in its darkest hour, but his health (thanks in part to a lifelong smoking habit) would never be the same.</p><img alt="Queen Elizabeth II" title="Queen Elizabeth II" width=3316 height=2076 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-74949485.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: POOL/ Tim Graham Picture Library/Getty Images</span><p>Queen Elizabeth in 2007</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The queen remains a fan of cars today</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1947, the usually deferential Elizabeth once again fought to get her own way. This time, she was determined to overcome the objections of her family and the British government to marry <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-philip data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Philip Mountbatten" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Philip Mountbatten</a>, a Greek-born, dashing young officer in the Royal Navy, who Elizabeth had fallen for at the age of 13. That November, with Britain still in a post-war economic downturn resulting in rationing, the couple married. Several of their children and grandchildren would follow in their footsteps by serving in the armed services, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-charles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Charles" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Prince Charles</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-andrew data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Andrew" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Prince Andrew</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-william data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince William" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Prince William</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-harry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Harry" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Prince Harry</a>, whose <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-harry-ends-10-year-career-with-the-army/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="10-year stint" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">10-year stint</a> in the British Army included two tours in Afghanistan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And while the queen is best known as a keen and passionate rider and breeder of horses, her teenage years in the ATS left their mark. She taught her children how to drive, and well into her 90s can frequently be seen behind the wheel of one of the many cars in the royal collection — and she’s been known to jump at the chance to diagnose and repair faulty engines and machinery, just as she was trained to do more than 70 years ago.</p><img alt="Princess Elizabeth conversing with her father, King George VI" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/11_princess-elizabeth-the-future-queen-elizabeth-ii-conversing-with-her-father-king-george-vi-1895---1952-in-a-garden-8th-july-1946-photo-by-lisa-sheridanstudio-lisahulton-archivegetty-images.jpg title="Princess Elizabeth conversing with her father, King George VI" width=3838 height=4790 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGipqLGRocG6e9CunJ6mXZq5qsbAm5ytoF2etm65xJyfmqaZmHq4u9Glm2avkad6qrU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rocio-sanchez-azuara-net-worth-317978.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roco Snchez Azuara Net Worth 2024">&larr;
