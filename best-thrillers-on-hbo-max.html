As Patrick Bateman, a character that was first offered to <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, Christian Bale turns in one of the most memorable performances of his career. Harron does a fantastic job of making the movie both brutally gruesome and repulsively humorous. Bateman is arguably the next anti-hero after Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. The legendary “It’s Hip To Be Square” segment from American Psycho, which features Jared Leto in a particularly entertaining way, also deserves praise.

Its characters are likeable, but bumbling, people who find themselves into trouble. The Coen brothers have a tremendous ear for dialogue and an eye for detail even at this early stage. The mere listening to the movie is enjoyable. Additionally, there is all that insane Coen violence, which can be both hilarious and scary. Additionally, the movie features a very early Frances McDormand performance.</p><p>EXPERIENCE ON HBO</p><h3><span id=Chinatown_1974>Chinatown (1974)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chinatown-1974.jpg alt="best thrillers on netflix,best thriller series on hbo max,hbo psychological thriller movies,hbo max psychological thriller series,hbo max suspense movies,best psychological thrillers hbo max,best thrillers on hbo max reddit,hbo thriller series,best thrillers on hbo max,best thrillers on hbo max right now,best thrillers on hbo max now,best thrillers on hbo max rotten tomatoes,best thrillers on hbo max april 2021,best thrillers on hbo max series,best psychological thrillers on hbo max,best new thrillers on hbo max,best action thrillers on hbo max,best crime thrillers on hbo max,best horror thrillers on hbo max,best suspense thrillers on hbo max,best mystery thrillers on hbo max,best sci fi thrillers on hbo max,best psychological thrillers on hbo max reddit,best psychological thrillers on hbo max 2022" width=1500 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Runtime: 2 hours and 11 minutes | Director: Roman Polanski</p><p>Cast: John Hillerman, Perry Lopez, Burt Young, <a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a>, Faye Dunaway, and John Huston</p><p>Chinatown is still considered to be one of the best screenplays in cinema history. It’s a detective story full of twists that follow genre norms but also twists that unquestionably defy assumptions. And at the centre of it all was a legendary performance by Jack Nicholson. Chinatown, like many detective stories, keeps building on its plot until it’s difficult to recall which thread you’re even following at any given time, but it manages to be constantly interesting throughout. Pair that with Who Framed Roger Rabbit for a very wild night.</p><p>EXPERIENCE ON HBO</p><h3><span id=Confidence_2003>Confidence (2003)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Confidence-2003.jpg alt="best thrillers on netflix,best thriller series on hbo max,hbo psychological thriller movies,hbo max psychological thriller series,hbo max suspense movies,best psychological thrillers hbo max,best thrillers on hbo max reddit,hbo thriller series,best thrillers on hbo max,best thrillers on hbo max right now,best thrillers on hbo max now,best thrillers on hbo max rotten tomatoes,best thrillers on hbo max april 2021,best thrillers on hbo max series,best psychological thrillers on hbo max,best new thrillers on hbo max,best action thrillers on hbo max,best crime thrillers on hbo max,best horror thrillers on hbo max,best suspense thrillers on hbo max,best mystery thrillers on hbo max,best sci fi thrillers on hbo max,best psychological thrillers on hbo max reddit,best psychological thrillers on hbo max 2022" width=1200 height=780 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>1 hour and 37 minutes long; James Foley directed it</p><p>Cast includes Andy Garcia, Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Burns.</p><p>A con artist and his gang rush to pull off another con after taking advantage of the wrong target. The fast-moving criminal drama Confidence, starring Edward Burns, features a cast full of award-winning actors, such as Dustin Hoffman (Hook) and Andy Garcia (Ocean’s Eleven). Confidence is supported by a gripping story written by Doug Jung (The Cloverfield Paradox), whose lines perfectly complement the performances, despite the film’s abundance of powerful actors. A playful and exciting adventure, Confidence is full of tension and unexpected turns.

From there, theft, deceit, and murder are involved. The movie is a non-stop adventure that takes the audience on a crazy trip while diving into the history (and intentions) of each character.

As the ideal loving and devoted housewife named Alice, Florence Pugh (Black Widow) continues to fascinate viewers as she unravels under the suspicion that her world is not what it seems. Pugh is great as she keeps the movie together, especially in difficult situations against Chris Pine, when paired with Harry Styles (My Policeman) (Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves). Don’t Worry Darling introduces a mountain of mystery and poses a barrage of intriguing questions.

While the renowned Oscar Isaac (<a href=#>Moon Knight</a>) and underrated Gleeson both give outstanding performances, Alicia Vikander (Tomb Raider), who plays an artificial named Ava, is the real star of Ex Machina.

The movie follows Zoe Kravitz as a tech worker named Angela and expertly captures the city. During the course of her work, Angela learns that there is a coverup that, in order to expose, requires her to leave the security of her apartment. The experience that ensues is incredibly tense as she must flee through the city’s hidden passageways while dodging a plethora of pursuers who would do anything to ensure she stays silent. Not only is Kravitz flawless in the part, but she also fully engages with the movie’s kinetic energy, which keeps things moving along smoothly. One of the most thoroughly enjoyable movie experiences you’ll ever have culminates in one of the most satisfying and cathartic conclusions.

The main character of the movie is Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), an aspiring fashion designer who is totally enamoured with the 1960s style. Eloise’s mother contemplated suicide when she was a youngster, and Eloise occasionally sees her ghost in mirrors. Eloise was raised by her grandmother. Eloise discovers she can travel back in time to the glitzy 1960s after meeting a stunning singer (Anya Taylor-Joy). However, when reality and dreams converge and the past and present clash, things take a tragic turn. Wright’s signature slick design and the great performances in Last Night in Soho have received high praise.

Leonard (Guy Pearce) has key details regarding the murder of his wife tattooed on his body so he won’t forget them. The film’s storyline is purposefully skewed to represent two timelines of events occurring concurrently. One moves along in <a href=#>black and white</a> over the course of multiple phone calls. The other, which is in colour, is displayed in reverse order and makes sure that important truths are revealed gradually and just when you least expect them. It is a movie that provides an early indication of Nolan’s interest in time and the way the mind perceives it, lifting the veil on one man’s psyche as he decides how he wants to live the remaining years of his life.

It does so after a deceptive Bradley Cooper plays Stanton Carlisle, a broken guy who learns mentalism as a member of a touring circus and realises he can trick others. He succeeds in making this a successful career, but he is willing to gamble all when he receives an offer for a sum of money that beyond his wildest expectations. Cooper gives one of his best performances in this tale of avarice, which takes us further and further inside the mind of a man who wants it all. The narrative demonstrates how he turns into a self-destructive force for both himself and others unlucky enough to be caught in his wake. It is a remake of the same-named classic that takes a different path, uncovering both arresting aesthetics and catastrophic devastation in the exploration of its own depravity.

Night Shyamalan</p><p>Vicky Krieps, Gael Bernal, and Rufus Sewell make up the cast.</p><p>Old is horror mastermind M. Night Shyamalan at his absolute best and most focused—and it’s still a really decent movie in and of itself. It relates the horrific tale of a beach that ages you, as you might have imagined. When an unexpected cast of characters shows up on the beach, they initially find it hard to accept what is happening before quickly realising there is no way to avert their seeming impending doom. Children grow into teens, then into adults, and adults become elderly people, then into death. Everything is exceedingly gloomy and frequently gory, resulting for a disconcerting experience that is carefully calibrated to elicit the greatest feeling of smothering anxiety. The nightmare voyage is undoubtedly unusual in that it sometimes turns fairly meaningful when you least expect it, even though there are times when it loses its edge toward the finish. Because of how deeply it hurts, the resulting movie transcends its appearance in memes.

Jackson, John Travolta, and Uma Thurman</p><p>But naturally. Pulp Fiction, the movie that simultaneously made Tarantino a “superstar” and inspired a plethora of copycats that would pour out of Hollywood over the following ten years. Look no farther than the fact that non-linear storytelling is now not just prevalent but also a mainstay of high-end television to determine the degree of Tarantino’s effect. Throughout the awards season, Tarantino and Forrest Gump were neck and neck, and while Robert Zemeckis’ story won Best Director and Best Picture, Tarantino at least won Best Original Screenplay. Regardless of the Oscars, Pulp Fiction is a timeless masterpiece that has cemented its status as a hugely influential—and just plain cool—work of art in cinema history. A.
