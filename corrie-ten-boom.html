It’s believed their efforts saved nearly 800 lives. Eventually betrayed by a fellow Dutch citizen, the entire family was imprisoned. However, Corrie survived and told her story in an autobiographical 1971 memoir The Hiding Place. Having grown up in a devoutly religious family, ten Boom also started a worldwide ministry and traveled around the world as a public speaker. She died in April 1983 on her 91st birthday.</p><h2 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Cornelia Arnolda Johanna ten Boom<br>BORN: April 15, 1892<br>DIED: April 15, 1983<br>BIRTHPLACE: Haarlem, Netherlands<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries</p><h2 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cornelia Arnolda Johanna ten Boom was born on April 15, 1892, in Haarlem, Netherlands, near Amsterdam. Known as “Corrie” all her life, she was the youngest child, with two sisters, Betsie and Nollie, and one brother, Willem. Their father, Casper, was a jeweler and watchmaker. Cornelia was named after her mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The ten Boom family lived in the Beje house in Haarlem (short for Barteljorisstraat, the street where the house was located) in rooms above Casper’s watch shop. Family members were strict Calvinists in the Dutch Reformed Church. Faith inspired them to serve society, offering shelter, food, and money to those in need. In this tradition, the family held a deep respect for the Jewish community in Amsterdam, considering them “God’s ancient people.”</p><h2 title="Watchmaking Career" data-anchor-id=watchmaking-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Watchmaking Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the death of her mother and a disappointing romance, Corrie trained to be a watchmaker and, in 1922, became the first woman licensed as a watchmaker in Holland. Over the next decade, in addition to working in her father’s shop, she established a youth club for teenage girls, which provided religious instruction as well as classes in the performing arts, sewing, and handicrafts.</p><h2 title="Efforts During World War II" data-anchor-id=efforts-during-world-war-ii class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Efforts During World War II</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 1940, the German Blitzkrieg ran though the Netherlands and the other Low Countries. Within months, the “Nazification” of the Dutch people began and the quiet life of the ten Boom family was changed forever.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the war, the Beje house became a refuge for Jews, students, and intellectuals. The façade of the watch shop made the house an ideal front for these activities. A secret room, no larger than a small wardrobe closet, was built into Corrie’s bedroom behind a false wall. The space could hold up to six people, all of whom had to stand quiet and still. A crude ventilation system was installed to provide air for the occupants. When security sweeps came through the neighborhood, a buzzer in the house would signal danger, allowing the refugees a little over a minute to seek sanctuary in the hiding place.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The entire ten Boom family became active in the Dutch resistance, risking their lives harboring those hunted by the Gestapo. Some fugitives would stay only a few hours, while others would stay several days until another safe house could be located. Corrie became a leader in the “Beje” movement, overseeing a network of safe houses in the country. Through these activities, it was estimated that 800 Jews’ lives were saved.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More World War II Figures</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On February 28, 1944, a Dutch informant told the Nazis of the ten Booms’ activities, and the Gestapo soon raided the home. They kept the house under surveillance, and by the end of the day, 35 people—including the entire ten Boom family—were arrested. Although German soldiers thoroughly searched the house, they didn’t find the half-dozen Jews safely concealed in the hiding place. The six stayed in the cramped space for nearly three days before being rescued by the Dutch underground.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">All ten Boom family members were incarcerated, including Corrie’s 84-year-old father, who soon died in the Scheveningen prison, located near The Hague. Corrie and her sister Betsie were remanded to the notorious Ravensbrück concentration camp, near Berlin. Betsie died there on December 16, 1944. Twelve days later, Corrie was released due to a clerical error.</p><h2 title="Work and Honors After the War" data-anchor-id=work-and-honors-after-the-war class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Work and Honors After the War</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ten Boom returned to the Netherlands after the war and set up a rehabilitation center for concentration camp survivors. In the Christian spirit to which she was so devoted, she also took in those who had cooperated with the Germans during the occupation. In 1946, she began a worldwide ministry that took her to more than 60 countries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She received many tributes during her lifetime, including being knighted by the queen of the Netherlands.
