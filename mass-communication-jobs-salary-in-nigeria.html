The truth about mass communication is that it is a very wide course and its beyond journalism, even though that is the major course in this field where most people build successful careers in.</p><p>As one who studied it, I can honestly tell you that studying any of the courses under mass communication is good and there are jobs in the media especially if you are fresher from the university with a Mass Communication degree. The only sad news is that most of these jobs, though fun can be demanding with low salary as payout depending on your level in whatever media establishment you find yourself.</p><p>For example, if you get a job as a Journalists in a print media house, you must have probably studied Journalism and mass media as a core course in mass communication. Well, the truth about this is that being a mass communication professional requires that you undertake any of its core courses to earn a degree or certificate that qualifies you to work in any organization or media firm that requires such.</p><p>If you want to know how much the salary of mass communicator professionals is or the jobs that exists after studying any of mass communication courses, you shall find the answers in this write-up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mass-communication-salary-in-nigeria></span><strong>Mass Communication Salary in Nigeria </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Professionals in the field of mass communication are known to earn higher salaries due to their many years of experience. This is in contrast to those who just want to start a career in the field.

The only pitfall in this category is that the take home pay in this field is too low when you put it side by side with other professions.</p><p>For instance, entry level journalists in The Sun Newspapers who starts as reporters earn about N50,000 while if you work at The Punch Newspaper as a reporter, you earn N150,000 plus other benefits. While both media houses are owned by private individuals, one pays higher than the other.

For those experienced in this aspect, the salary scale should be between N250,000 to N400,000 depending if its on contractual basis or if you are a full staff.
