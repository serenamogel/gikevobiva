The show followed five couples who got engaged after dating in individual “pods” without being able to see each other. By the finale episode, three original couples were engaged, and a new one had formed.

As the experiment continues to expand, each participant’s individual journey, emotional growth, and ability to embrace a new approach to dating is key — whether they find love outwardly or within. In the most shocking season yet, the singles face new challenges, unexpected twists, and surprising turns that will test their personal resolve, and the strength of their connections, more than ever before. Even if the couples can forge a strong enough bond to get engaged sight unseen, can their love survive the challenges waiting for them in the outside world — including protective families, skeptical friends, and the exes they thought they’d left behind?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In his chat with Women’s Health, Nick confirmed that fans will continue to see diverse couples. “There is quite a bit of diversity in the casting,” he noted. “Speaking as someone who’s there [sic] from day one, and sees all the people that are there from day one, I do think that they’ve [the casting directors] done a good job of trying to cast diversely and will continue to. You’ll see that in season three and four and five.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uorZ5lmah6o7jIp5tmq5WWwLC6jG5knJmjqXqxvsSmoJ6qlWKxosDEZmxpb2ZpgnV7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./choi-soo-young.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Choi Soo Young  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
