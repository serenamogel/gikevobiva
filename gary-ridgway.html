In 2002, Ridgway directed investigators to the area, admitting he had placed two victims there. The Green River Killer is currently serving multiple life sentences at Washington State Penitentiary.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Razpotnik’s mother, Donna Hurley, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/us/victim-green-river-killer-identified.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The New York Times" data-vars-ga-product-id=b78fe842-29da-4a55-bb3a-8b9eadf9899a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/us/victim-green-river-killer-identified.html data-product-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/us/victim-green-river-killer-identified.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fus%2Fvictim-green-river-killer-identified.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f0c316fa-4f1f-40e4-98c1-029b9bd1b70e class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">told The New York Times</a> she had repeatedly wondered if Ridgway played a role in her daughter’s disappearance but dismissed it. “It was easier to go on with life thinking that she was alive and well and raising a family and, you know, just being herself,” Hurley said.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Who Is Gary Ridgway?

He began murdering women in 1982 and was caught in 2001 when a DNA test had revealed a match. Ridgway has claimed he killed as many as 75 to 80 women along Route 99 in south King County, Washington. He eventually pleaded guilty to 49 counts of aggravated first-degree murder and has received multiple life sentences in prison, where he remains today.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Gary Leon Ridgway<br>BORN: February 18, 1949<br>BIRTHPLACE: Salt Lake City, Utah<br>SPOUSES: Claudia Barrows (1970-1972), Marcia Brown (1973-1981), and Judith Lynch (1988-2002)<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gary Leon Ridgway was born on February 18, 1949, in Salt Lake City. Raised near Seattle’s Pacific Highway, a deprived neighborhood near SeaTac airport, Ridgway was a poor student and was sent to Vietnam after high school. When he returned, he got a job painting trucks, which he kept for 30 years. Although he married three times and was fanatical about religion, Ridgway was a frequent customer of prostitutes.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="Green River Killings" data-anchor-id=green-river-killings class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Green River Killings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ridgway’s slayings began in 1982, when young runaways and prostitutes began disappearing from state Route 99 in south King County, Washington. He brought many of them to his home and strangled them, then left them in woodsy, remote sites. The first few bodies turned up along the now-notorious Green River.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dubbed the Green River Killer, Ridgway eluded the law until 2001, when King County sheriff Dave Reichert, the first officer assigned to the case in 1982, called a meeting to re-examine evidence using newly developed DNA-testing technology. The analysis produced a match between evidence from the victims and Ridgway, and he was charged with four counts of aggravated murder in December 2001. Ridgway eventually pleaded guilty to 49 counts of aggravated first-degree murder.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 title="Multiple Life Sentences" data-anchor-id=multiple-life-sentences class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Multiple Life Sentences</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Facing the prospect of execution, Ridgway made a deal with investigators to revealed where he had hidden the bodies of several of the young women who had yet to be found while also agreeing to plead guilty to any future cases where his confession could be substantiated by evidence. He was sentenced to life in prison in December 2003, having committed more murders than any serial killer in American history. Ridgway is currently incarcerated at Washington State Penitentiary.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An additional body was found in 2011, with Ridgway receiving another life sentence. In 2013, he claimed in a media interview that he had murdered 75 to 80 women, with speculation over Ridgway was telling the truth or seeking further attention.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 title="Recently Identified Victims" data-anchor-id=recently-identified-victims class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Recently Identified Victims</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2020, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/colorado-girl-who-ran-away-in-1983-linked-through-dna-to-unidentified-remains-from-green-river-case/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="police identified 14-year-old Wendy Stephens" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">police identified 14-year-old Wendy Stephens</a> as Ridgway’s youngest known victim.

Ridgway admitted in 2002 that he placed two of his victims in the area where Razpotnik was found.</p>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
