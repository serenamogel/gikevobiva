He made his mainstream breakthrough in 2000 with his second album, Back for the First Time, and has since become a label boss, restaurateur and philanthropist, while still releasing music. He is also a regular in the Fast and the Furious film franchise. What marks out Ludacris as an innovator is his comedic flow, peppered with punchlines — a style that fits his chosen stage name perfectly.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ludacris was born Christopher Brian Bridges in Champaign, Illinois, on September 11, 1977, the only child of college students Roberta and Wayne. His parents split when he was young — although he remained close to both — and he moved to Atlanta with his mom around the age of 12. He had been rapping since the age of nine, and before the move to Atlanta was a member of a childhood group, the Loudmouth Hooligans. Times were tough for the teenage Bridges and his mom, but he credits her for being strict with him to ensure he stayed in school and studied hard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ludacris had his first brush with stardom in 1998 with a guest verse on Timbaland’s debut album — Tim’s Bio: Life from Da Bassment — rhyming on the track "Phat Rabbit." He was already recording his debut album, Incognegro, with production from Jermaine Dupri, Bangladesh and Organized Noize, which he released independently on his own Disturbing Tha Peace label in May 2000.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Breakthrough With 'Back for the First Time'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Much of the material on the album would be repackaged for his major label debut, Back for the First Time, after he was signed to Def Jam South in 2000, including the hit single "What’s Your Fantasy." The song was remixed for the new album, with additional guest verses from Trina and Foxy Brown, while the second single, the Neptunes-produced and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/pharrell-williams data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pharrell class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pharrell</a>-featuring "Southern Hospitality," was another new addition. The album reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200, eventually selling more than 3 million copies. Rolling Stone picked up on Ludacris' lively rap style, calling him “that rare brand of rapper who shows you his skills as much as he tells you about them.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Word of Mouf' Spreads, Pepsi Controversy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ludacris kept the charge going in 2001 with his next album, Word of Mouf. Its lead single, "Rollout (My Business)," was nominated for a Grammy and followed up by three more singles. Collaborations with Nate Dogg and Twista made the album a lively affair that racked up more than 3 million sales in the U.S. alone. Critics again singled out Ludacris’ verbal dexterity, with the Los Angeles Times praising him for keeping "the laughs coming, injecting some sort of humor into nearly every line of the 19 songs.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ludacris showcased the artists signed to his DTP label on his 2002 compilation Golden Grain, including a then-unknown MC called Tity Boi who would later go on to find fame as 2 Chainz. Ludacris struck an advertising deal with Pepsi around this time, which erupted into minor scandal when the Fox News host <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/bill-oreilly data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bill O’Reilly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bill O’Reilly</a> called for a boycott of the drink for choosing someone who used obscene lyrics. Pepsi subsequently dropped Ludacris, but after action by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/russell-simmons data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Russell Simmons" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Russell Simmons</a>’ Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, the company eventually agreed to make $3 million in donations to urban charities.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Chicken-n-Beer' Goes to No. 1</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following year saw even greater success for Ludacris with the release of Chicken-n-Beer. The album sold more than 400,000 copies in its first week and was later propelled by hit singles "Splash Waterfalls" and "Stand Up," the latter a club banger produced by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kanye-west data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kanye West" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kanye West</a>. Chicken-n-Beer topped the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Ludacris his first No. 1 album.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Acting in the 'Fast & the Furious' Franchise</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Ludacris starred as Tej Parker in 2 Fast 2 Furious, the sequel to The Fast and the Furious. According to its director, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/john-singleton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Singleton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Singleton</a>, Ludacris was cast in 2002 after fellow rapper Ja Rule, who was in the original movie, “got too big for himself” and turned it down. Ludacris would go on to appear in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth installments of the series.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ludacris has many other screen credits to his name, branching out from parts as a rapper (2005's Hustle & Flow) and thief (2005's Crash) to supporting performances in romantic comedies like 2011's No Strings Attached and a leading voice role in 2018's Show Dogs.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Red Light District,' 'Release Therapy' and Grammys</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/nas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Nas class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nas</a> and DMX were among the guests on The Red Light District in 2004, another No. 1 album. Ludacris received his first Grammy award in 2005 — having been previously nominated more than a dozen times — for "Yeah!," a collaboration with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/usher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Usher class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Usher</a>. Ludacris would pick up two more Grammys in 2007, for his single "Money Maker" and album Release Therapy. His first concept album, it interspersed party and dance tracks with more reflective and political moments although maintaining, as The New Yorker concluded, “a concise demonstration of his midnight-blue humor and bumptious oratory.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">More Albums, Restaurant and Foundation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While his later albums — Theater of the Mind in 2008, Battle of the Sexes in 2010 and Ludaversal in 2015 — show a decline in both sales and productivity, much of this is down to Ludacris’ focus on other aspects of his career, including acting and philanthropy. He opened a Chicken-n-Beer restaurant at the Atlanta airport at the end of 2016 and has a stake in Conjure Cognac. His Ludacris Foundation, founded in 2001, focuses on community outreach to youth.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014 Ludacris married Gabonese model Eudoxie Mbouguiengue, and they have a daughter, Cadence Gaelle. He has three other daughters from previous relationships — Cai Bella Bridges, Karma Bridges and Shaila Scott.</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Ludacris</li><li>Birth Year: 1977</li><li>Birth date: September 11, 1977</li><li>Birth State: Illinois</li><li>Birth City: Champaign</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Ludacris is a rapper and actor known for personifying the 'Dirty South' style of rap music and starring as Tej Parker in 'The Fast and the Furious' films.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Action</li><li>Radio</li><li>Drama</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Virgo</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Georgia State University</li><li>Oak Park and River Forest High School</li></ul><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Ludacris is cousins with comedian Katt Williams and distant cousins with Richard Pryor.</li><li>Ludacris is a self-proclaimed germophobe.</li></ul></ul>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
