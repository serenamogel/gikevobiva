In addition, he committed himself when he heard the police at the door.&nbsp;Raheel Ahmed, a citizen of Georgia, drove to Streeterville to face Sania. Since his family had filed a missing person report with Atlanta police, officers were sent to the apartment on East Ohio Street to conduct a welfare check on him.</p><p>The moment Chicago police knocked on the door, they heard a gunshot. Upon admission, they discovered Sania’s corpse lying near the door, shot in the back of the head. Ahmed was afterward discovered in a bedroom with the same injuries.</p><p>Ahmed and Khan ended their relationship in the winter of 2021. Khan’s relationship with her parents was strained since they did not support her choice to divorce Ahmed, despite his aggressive and poisonous behavior throughout the marriage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sania-Khan-2.jpg alt="Sania Khan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>All information is known about Sania Khan</h2><p>Sania Khan was a photographer and content developer whose forte was candid photography.
